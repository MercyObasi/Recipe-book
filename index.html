      <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Let roast stand at room temperature for
          1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, boil balsamic vinegar until
          it reduces to 1/4 cup, approximately 3 minutes. Remove from heat and
          set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finely mince the parsley. Mix together with the minced garlic, 1/4
          teaspoon salt, and a generous amount of pepper. Using the tip of a
          sharp knife, bore 7 to 10 narrow holes, each about 1 1/2" deep, in the
          rib roast. Fill the holes with the parsley-garlic mixture. Spread any
          remaining mixture over the surface of the roast. Sprinkle all sides of
          the meat with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class="heat">
          Place the roast, ribs down in a roasting pan. Roast for 15 minutes.
          Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F. and continue to roast an
          additional 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches
          desired temperature on a meat thermometer (see below).
          <ul>
            <li>Rare - 120 degrees F</li>
            <li>Medium Rare - 125 degrees F</li>
            <li>Medium - 130 degrees F</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from oven and transfer onto a cutting board; let stand 15
          minutes before carving (the internal temperature will rise 5 to 10
          degrees after it is removed from the oven).
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat in the roasting pan. The pan juices
          should be few but concentrated and caramelized. Place the roasting pan
          over two (2) burners on high heat. Add the water, scraping up all the
          browned bits on the bottom of the pan and stirring until they are
          incorporated. Boil the liquid until it reduces to 3/4 cup,
          approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in enough of the balsamic glaze to create a tart edge in the
          flavor of the juices, approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons. (Reserve any
          extra glaze for another use.) Add the Worcestershire to the sauce;
          remove from heat and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          After slicing the roast, add any accumulated meat juices to the
          balsamic sauce. Serve the meat slices on warmed plates with balsamic
          sauce on the side.
        </li>
      </ol>
